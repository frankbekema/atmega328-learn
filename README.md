# ATMega328(PU) learn
Welcome to Frank Bekema's arduino project.

The goal of this project is to learn more about embedded controllers and how to program them.

## Requirements
- avrdude
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software)

## Milestones
- [ ] Program an arduino without the arduio IDE.
  - [ ] Write an Makefile that uses the arduino IDE and compiles the code with that.
  - [ ] Use avrdude to upload the code
- [x] Write a command handler
- [ ] Write a SPI command handler
  - [ ] Master
  - [ ] Slave
- [ ] Communicate with two arduino's
- [x] Build an electronic circuit with the ATMega328PU
- [ ] Program an ATMega328PU over SPI
- [ ] Write some simple code that works on the ATMega328PU
  - [ ] Let a LED flash
